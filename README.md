# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Churn Prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service.Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.
The project aims to develop a machine learning model for accurate customer churn prediction. The prediction lets us understand the behaviour of consumers, predicting when customers are likely to churn and reduce the loss and enhance the customer retention strategies.
